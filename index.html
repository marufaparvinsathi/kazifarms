                            <h6>Kazi Farms is the market leader in production of composted organic fertiliser. This product has many benefits for farmers.It is produced by the composting action of aerobic bacteria on poultry manure, which results in a natural fertiliser which is high in organic matter. Many soils in Bangladesh are low in organic matter due to high frequency of plantation and excess use of chemical fertilizers.By increasing the organic content of soil, it increases water retention and so reduces the cost of irrigation. Increase of water retention also reducing run-off wastage of chemical fertilisers due to rainfall.</h6>
